• **What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?**

I learned that CSS padding was not as straightforward as I anticipated. Many times I was unable to get certain CSS elements to work because other CSS elements were affecting the HTML tag I was trying to style. It was frustrating that at times I could not get the styling right, but persevered and I feel as if now I have a better understanding of padding, borders, and margins.

• **What did you learn about CSS positioning?**

I didn't learn too much with this challenge, as I was applying what I had learned previously during the week. I did learn about the overflow property, which specifies what happens if content goes into another element's box. It's very useful if the border of an element collapses.

• **What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?**

The easiest part of my design to implement was the nav-bar with the effects that I wanted. The most difficult part to implement was getting things to line up exactly the way I wanted. The CSS got really complicated and it took me hours to get it right!

• **What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**

I learned that keeping one's classes, ids, and tag edits orderly is much more complicated than I anticipated. I had difficulty with the cascading order of  precedence and inheritance, and when research didn't reveal a solution, I was only able to solve some of my CSS problems by trial and error. This was time consuming and it taught me the lesson that it's better to plan one's CSS ahead of time and really understand its structure before getting excited and diving into changing the way the HTML looks.
