             <b> What are the benefits of Version Control?</b> 
            </br>
            Version control allows users to view the entire history of revisions to one or more files, and merge revisions made by different people. One way to use version control is through GitHub, a web based version control and source code management system. Since version control allows each individual user to work on their own iteration of the file, it makes collaboration far easier. It also allows for quality control, since potential changes to the master file are peer-reviewed before they are merged. In addition, version control lets teams see each individual change in a log history, and it is possible to revert back to any revision in case of an error. This makes experimenting with new features for a program far less risky. Finally, version control acts as a back-up for your files, since a full version of any given file is saved on the web.

          <b>How does git help you keep track of changes?</b>
          </br>
            Git allows developers to track and control the changes made by various individual users to files. Git allows users to convert local folders to git repositories, which are version controlled folders. This allows users to access past versions for reference, and roll back previous commits, which are save points in git. <br> Each commit has: </br>
          <ul>
            <li>A unique id that is a string of numbers and letters.</li>
            <li>A message that details the change made in the save point. This should be specific.</li>
            <li>The author of the commit.</li>
            <li>A timestamp. This helps in dealing with bugs.</li>
            </ul>
      </p>

      <b>Why use GitHub to store your code?</b>
      </br>
            While GitHub has certain shortcomings, such as requiring payment in order to store private repositories, it's among the best free alternatives for Open Source projects. GitHub is the most popular version control management system, and this makes it easy to get feedback on your projects. In addition, due to its popularity and very active community, GitHub also has a very thorough help section and even guides for whatever Git issue one might be having difficulties with.
