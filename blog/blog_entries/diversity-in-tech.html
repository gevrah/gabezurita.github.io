        Diversity in Tech

     Even though I was born, raised, and lived over half my life in Chile, I'm not brown like most people think I should be. This has its benefits and its costs. If my last name wasn't Latino, then it'd help the chances of getting a job in STEM. A definite benefit is that the lighter color of my skin allows me to blend in the midst of the majority and not face daily prejudice. Yet this simultaneously creates a barrier between me and most Latinos.

    Spanish is my primary language, yet the Latinos in the bodega near my apartment in Wicker Park will rarely speak Spanish back to me. Even though one cashier regularly spoke Spanish to all other Latinos in line, it took her over a month to finally do so with me, at which point she exclaimed "Oh, I thought you were a gringo trying to speak Spanish to us." Discrimination is everywhere. This happens to me often enough that I rarely bother speaking my native tongue in Chicago.

    It's odd to be writing about diversity in tech. I feel like an impostor for saying that there aren't enough of my people in STEM fields. The tech sector is predominately White, Asian, and male. In my Dev Bootcamp cohort, I didn't see too many Latino last names other than mine. A USA today article writes that only 2 percent of Google's employees are Latino in a state which has a Latin-American population of 39 percent. That's painful to hear and makes me wonder how many times my last name will lead to my resume not even being read.

    I've thought of changing my last name to increase my chances, but would that not be some sort of disgusting betrayal of my roots, of the core of what makes me who I am? Could I be happy working for a company that would've passed up my resume if the last name on it had been Latino? The answer is no. My last name forms a useful filter of sorts. I will not change my last name and I'll instead hope for greater inclusion as people learn to see past the cultural and ethnic barriers that divide us all.
