  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hi! I'm Gabriel. I'm a Chilean-USA dual citizen currently residing in Chicago. I was born and have lived most of my life in Chile, though I feel no nationalism for Chile or any nation. I feel as if my experience of being raised in two countries has helped me to see past the socio-political, geographic boundaries that separate us. We are all just humans attempting to survive and hopefully thrive. The world seems small to me, and it doesn't seem that we're as far apart or as different as many of us think we are.</p>
